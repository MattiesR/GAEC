We are solving the travleing salesman problem on a graph with an genetic algorithm. We are looking for the shortest path between nodes

your data in the given csv is a graph representation by a  nxn  matrix with distances between the nodes in each cell.  If 2 cells are not directly connected, they have a distance of infinite. Its a directed graph.

You have the given code template.

please generate each step of the following exercise:

Generate a representation, the objective function „length“, a simple population initialization, a selection mechanism, one mutation operator, one recombination operator, an elimination mechanism, and a stopping criterion that corresponds to the design that you developed in the first exercise session

representation:
* a possilbe path representation would be a list with all nodes visited in the circle. As the starting (and endpoint) are always fixed, we can just ignore vertex 1

Initialization: 
* start with random population of possible paths (easy).
* it could be worth it to test for feasability (length != inf.) at initialization


Selection: 
* decide on a basic way to do this - we thought about k tournament selection 


Variation:
* Mutation: All basics for permuations
* Combination: order crossover 

elimination:
* some form of elitism (always keep top 5 percent)
* besides that decide on a strategy
